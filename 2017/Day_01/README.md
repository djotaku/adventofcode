# Day 01 - Inverse Captcha

Out of respect for the author's wishes, I only put as much of the problem text as necessary to understand the problem.

## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
Looks like I'll use the strategy I used for 2015 Day 05:

```python
double_letter = re.compile(r'(.)\1')
```

Then do a separate check to compare the first and last number.

### Part 2
I think for this part, it's probably better not to use regex. Just search within Python.
