# Day 3: Squares With Three Sides

Out of respect for the author's wishes, I only put as much of the problem text as necessary to understand the problem.

Visit the version with all the story elements [here](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/3).

## Part 1
In a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be larger than the remaining side. For example, the "triangle" given above is impossible, because 5 + 10 is not larger than 25.

In your puzzle input, how many of the listed triangles are possible?

Answer: 
## Part 2

## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
I went into part 1 with the attitude/belief: Seems easy as valid_triangle function that evaluates the numbers, summing all the pairs and returning false if any is < the length of the third one.
