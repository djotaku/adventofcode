## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
Initial idea is to create a function that will figure out what to change with tgl. Might do if/else or match statements.
Need to check not only the length of the list (how many arguments), but also if the toggled instruction is invalid.

### Part 2
I am guessing I need to change something to multiplication or the program runs forever? He mentions "add one", so I figure I can change that to multiply?
