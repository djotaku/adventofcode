# Day 6: Signals and Noise

Out of respect for the author's wishes, I only put as much of the problem text as necessary to understand the problem.

Visit the version with all the story elements [here](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/6).

## Part 1
All you need to do is figure out which character is most frequent for each position. For example, suppose you had recorded the following messages:

    eedadn
    drvtee
    eandsr
    raavrd
    atevrs
    tsrnev
    sdttsa
    rasrtv
    nssdts
    ntnada
    svetve
    tesnvt
    vntsnd
    vrdear
    dvrsen
    enarar

The most common character in the first column is e; in the second, a; in the third, s, and so on. Combining these characters returns the error-corrected message, easter.

Given the recording in your puzzle input, what is the error-corrected version of the message being sent?

## Part 2

## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
My initial approach to the problem: For each position, have a Count dict (or tally hash in Ruby or map/hash in Go/Perl) and then have it spit out #1 for each position. Should actually be a lot easier than Day 4 part 2.
