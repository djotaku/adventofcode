# Advent of Code 2016 - Saving Christmas From the Easter Bunny

The Easter Bunny has stolen the stars that power Santa's sleigh. You head to Easter Bunny HQ to get them back.

Advent of Code 2016 can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2016).

My third Advent of Code Problem Set

My goal for the 2016 problem sets are:

- Keep working with Python, Ruby, and Perl
- Learn Go
- Learn Haskell
- In general my aim is to get more and more idiomatic with each language as the days go by.
- To have fun solving programming puzzles

## Days I could not complete
### Part 1 Sections Still incomplete:
- Day 10 - I am not sure what the algorithm is
- Day 11 - I don't know how to do this algorithmically
- Day 13 - I think this is depth-first or breadth-first search, but I haven't remembered how to do this since undergrad (almost 20 years ago)
### Part 2 Sections Still incomplete:
### Language Specific
- Day 01 Haskell - I had a hard enough time with part 1. I'll come back to this when I've got more Haskell experience.
- Day 03 Haskell - Without for loops and variables I could assign, I couldn't figure out how to grab every 3 rows, transpose, eval, sum, and then move on to the next three rows.
- Day 04 Haskell - Partially solved, but need to return to this
- Day 05 Haskell - Wil come back to it
## What I learned from Advent of Code 2016

A distillation of what I learned this year:
- TBD!


For a full list of what I learned, for each day the README will contain what I learned in each programming language.

### Python

### Ruby


### Perl

### Go

### Haskell

## note to self

using toolbox to be able to install cpan and ruby gems without mucking with system.
