## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
This seems similar to the bus problem from 2020. I need to figure out the math that would allow this to shortcut instead of running a
simulation. I think that a sim might work OK for part 1, but I'm pretty sure it won't work for part 2.

First guess is that I add 1 to the modulo per each disc to allow for the second that each disc consumes.

Eventually, I ended up going with the direct simulation route.

### Part 2
First attempt will be to simply insert the new disc into the list and see if that works.
