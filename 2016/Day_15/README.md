# Timing is Everything

Out of respect for the author's wishes, I only put as much of the problem text as necessary to understand the problem.

## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
This seems similar to the bus problem from 2020. I need to figure out the math that would allow this to shortcut instead of running a
simulation. I think that a sim might work OK for part 1, but I'm pretty sure it won't work for part 2.

First guess is that I add 1 to the modulo per each disc to allow for the second that each disc consumes.
