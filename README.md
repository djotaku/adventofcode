# Advent of Code

In 2020 I discovered https://adventofcode.com/ via the Python Discord server. 

This repo contains my solutions to the Daily Challenges in folders by year. Each day also has the problem description and any lessons I learned.

## Event Years

- 2020
    - First Year of Participation
    - Solved with Python (initially, when I’m all caught up I may go back and add more languages)
    - 34 Stars Collected So Far
    
### Lessons learned from all my years of doing this
“A distillation of what I learned each year. (which is itself a distillation of what I learned daily”

- Learn algorithms for Conway’s Game of Life
- Learn Recursion and Memoization (Caching)
- Use Unit Tests to keep from going mad
- Solving programming puzzles is addictive
- From doing the problems in more than one language:
    - While you can more or less ape general programming across any language, learning how to take advantage of each language’s quirks, build-in libraries, and paradigms is a lot of fun and can show how some are better at certain problems than others
    - I prefer languages without semicolons to languages with semicolons
