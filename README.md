# Advent of Code

In 2020 I discovered https://adventofcode.com/ via the Python Discord server. 

This repo contains my solutions to the Daily Challenges in folders by year. Each day also has the problem description and any lessons I learned.

## Event Years

- 2015 
    - Second Problem Set Tackled (April 2021 - TBD)
    - Originally solved with Python, Ruby, and Perl (other languages may be used in the future)
    - 30 Stars Collected So Far
- 2016
  - Third Problem Set Tackled (TBD)
  - Planned to solve with Python, Ruby, Perl, Haskell, and Go
  - 0 stars Collected so Far
- 2017
  - Fourth Problem Set Tackled (MAYBE? I'll probably do 2021 live first; TBD)
  - Unknown which languages will be added. Considering Rust, Java, Kotlin, Javascript
- 2020
    - First Year of Participation (1st attempt: Live Dec 2020; Trying to get all 50 stars: TBD)
    - Solved with Python (initially, when I’m all caught up I may go back and add more languages)
    - 34 Stars Collected So Far
    
### Lessons learned from all my years of doing this
A distillation of what I learned each year. (which is itself a distillation of what I learned daily)

- Learn algorithms for Conway’s Game of Life
- Learn Recursion and Memoization (Caching)
- Often (maybe always, but not in my limited experience) the answer comes down to: map, filter, reduce
- Use Unit Tests to keep from going mad
- Solving programming puzzles is addictive
- From doing the problems in more than one language:
    - While you can more or less ape general programming across any language, learning how to take advantage of each language’s quirks, build-in libraries, and paradigms is a lot of fun and can show how some are better at certain problems than others
    - I prefer languages without semicolons to languages with semicolons
