# Advent of Code

In 2020 I discovered https://adventofcode.com/ via the Python Discord server. 

This repo contains my solutions to the Daily Challenges in folders by year. Each day also has the problem description and any lessons I learned.

## Event Years

- 2015 
    - Second Problem Set Tackled (April 2021 - Sept 2021)

After I'm all caught up, I may try my hand at some visualizations.
    
### Lessons learned from all my years of doing this
A distillation of what I learned each year. (which is itself a distillation of what I learned daily)

- Learn algorithms for Conway’s Game of Life
- Learn Recursion and Memoization (Caching)
- Often (maybe always, but not in my limited experience) the answer comes down to: map, filter, reduce
- Use Unit Tests to keep from going mad
- For performance reasons you usually want to use a map/hash/dict rather than a list/array/vector/slice
- Solving programming puzzles is addictive
- From doing the problems in more than one language:
    - While you can more or less ape general programming across any language, learning how to take advantage of each language’s quirks, build-in libraries, and paradigms is a lot of fun and can show how some are better at certain problems than others
    - I prefer languages without semicolons to languages with semicolons
