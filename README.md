# Advent of Code

In 2020 I discovered https://adventofcode.com/ via the Python Discord server. 

This repo contains my solutions to the Daily Challenges in folders by year. Each day also has the problem description and any lessons I learned.

## Event Years

- 2015 
    - Second Problem Set Tackled (April 2021 - Sept 2021)
    - Originally solved with Python, Ruby, and Perl (other languages may be used in the future)
    - 50 Stars Collected
      - 20210828 - Reached 34 stars without skipping any Days/Parts. This put me in a tie with my score at the end of 2020 when I was doing it live Dec 2020.
      - 20210919 - Finished my first ever Advent of Code with all 50 stars!!!! (Still need to do a few more days in Perl/Ruby)
    - Nerdy tidbit: At end of 2015 repo code was split as follows:
      - 63.6% Python
      - 18.7% Ruby
      - 17.6% Perl
      - 0.1% Shell
- 2016
  - Third Problem Set Tackled (Oct 2021 - )
  - Originally solved with Python, Ruby, Perl, Haskell, and Go
  - 10 stars Collected so Far
- 2017

  - Languages: Rust and Julia (“One hard one and one easy one”)
- 2020
    - First Year of Participation (1st attempt: Live Dec 2020; Trying to get all 50 stars: Sept 2021 -)
    - Solved with Python only during AoC

Total Stars Over All Years: 93

After I'm all caught up, I may try my hand at some visualizations.
    
### Lessons learned from all my years of doing this
A distillation of what I learned each year. (which is itself a distillation of what I learned daily)

- Learn algorithms for Conway’s Game of Life
- Learn Recursion and Memoization (Caching)
- Often (maybe always, but not in my limited experience) the answer comes down to: map, filter, reduce
- Use Unit Tests to keep from going mad
- Solving programming puzzles is addictive
- From doing the problems in more than one language:
    - While you can more or less ape general programming across any language, learning how to take advantage of each language’s quirks, build-in libraries, and paradigms is a lot of fun and can show how some are better at certain problems than others
    - I prefer languages without semicolons to languages with semicolons
