# Advent of Code 2021 - 

framing device description

My fourth Advent of Code Problem set and the second one I'm doing live.

During Dec 2021 I will be solving the problems in Python. If I happen to finish it quickly, I may try the problem out in one of the other languages I know: Ruby, Perl, Go, or Haskell. Eventually (perhaps even a couple years out from now) I will do all the problems in all these languages and more as practice.
