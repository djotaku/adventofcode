# Advent of Code 2021 - 

The keys to Santa's sleigh has fallen into the ocean. The stars power the antenna to find it.

My fourth Advent of Code Problem set and the second one I'm doing live.

During Dec 2021 I will be solving the problems in Python. If I happen to finish it quickly, I may try the problem out in one of the other languages I know: Ruby, Perl, Go, or Haskell. Eventually (perhaps even a couple years out from now) I will do all the problems in all these languages and more as practice.
