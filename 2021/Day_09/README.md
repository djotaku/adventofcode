# Day 9: Smoke Basin

Out of respect for the author's wishes, I only put as much of the problem text as necessary to understand the problem.

## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
This actually doesn't seem too hard. My plan is to do what I did for Conway in the 2015 problem set - create a dictionary to represent points. Then I can go through each point and check its neighbors to see if it's a minima. Dictionaries help along the edges and corners because they're a lot less work than a list to check.  Speaking of Conway, curious if that ends up being part 2 - some kind of smoke modeling.

So this may be a little complex given how large the input is. I'll DEFINITELY need to use a unit test to make sure I'm getting the indexes, neighbors, etc right. Overall doesn't seem too hard, just more work than I can do before starting my day today.
