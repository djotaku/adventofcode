# What I learned about Python from this day's problem
    
## Part 1
- Nothing    

## Part 2
- To print in python 3 without creating a newline, you need to do: 
```python
print(".", end="")
```
What you have in the quotes in end is what comes after the first argument. Here I didn't want any space.
