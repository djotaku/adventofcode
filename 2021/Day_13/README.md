# Day 13: Transparent Origami

Out of respect for the author's wishes, I only put as much of the problem text as necessary to understand the problem.

Visit the version with all the story elements [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/13).

## Part 1
The transparent paper is marked with random dots and includes instructions on how to fold it up (your puzzle input). For example:

    6,10
    0,14
    9,10
    0,3
    10,4
    4,11
    6,0
    6,12
    4,1
    0,13
    10,12
    3,4
    3,0
    8,4
    1,10
    2,14
    8,10
    9,0

    fold along y=7
    fold along x=5

The first section is a list of dots on the transparent paper. 0,0 represents the top-left coordinate. The first value, x, increases to the right. The second value, y, increases downward. So, the coordinate 3,0 is to the right of 0,0, and the coordinate 0,7 is below 0,0. The coordinates in this example form the following pattern, where # is a dot on the paper and . is an empty, unmarked position:

    ...#..#..#.
    ....#......
    ...........
    #..........
    ...#....#.#
    ...........
    ...........
    ...........
    ...........
    ...........
    .#....#.##.
    ....#......
    ......#...#
    #..........
    #.#........

Then, there is a list of fold instructions. Each instruction indicates a line on the transparent paper and wants you to fold the paper up (for horizontal y=... lines) or left (for vertical x=... lines). In this example, the first fold instruction is fold along y=7, which designates the line formed by all of the positions where y is 7 (marked here with -):

    ...#..#..#.
    ....#......
    ...........
    #..........
    ...#....#.#
    ...........
    ...........
    -----------
    ...........
    ...........
    .#....#.##.
    ....#......
    ......#...#
    #..........
    #.#........

Because this is a horizontal line, fold the bottom half up.

after the fold is complete, those dots appear in the top left corner (at 0,0 and 0,1). Because the paper is transparent, the dot just below them in the result (at 0,3) remains visible, as it can be seen through the transparent paper.

Also notice that some dots can end up overlapping; in this case, the dots merge together and become a single dot.

How many dots are visible after completing just the first fold instruction on your transparent paper?

Answer: 638
## Part 2

## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
Starting idea is to count how far form the fold line to the dots and use that to do math on their new locations. Doesn't seem too hard.
