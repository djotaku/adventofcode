## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
For some reason, this seems to me like it might be awesome for Haskell.

Anyway, it seems to me that the approach to take is to design a recursive function. If either explosion or splitting needs to happen, do it then call the function again. If none of them have to be done you're at the base case and you just return.
