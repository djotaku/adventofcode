# Title of Problem

Out of respect for the author's wishes, I only put as much of the problem text as necessary to understand the problem.

## Part 1
- inp a - Read an input value and write it to variable a.
- add a b - Add the value of a to the value of b, then store the result in variable a.
- mul a b - Multiply the value of a by the value of b, then store the result in variable a.
- div a b - Divide the value of a by the value of b, truncate the result to an integer, then store the result in variable a. (Here, "truncate" means to round the value toward zero.)
- mod a b - Divide the value of a by the value of b, then store the remainder in variable a. (This is also called the modulo operation.)
- eql a b - If the value of a and b are equal, then store the value 1 in variable a. Otherwise, store the value 0 in variable a.
