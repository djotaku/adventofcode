# Day 1: Sonar Sweep

Out of respect for the author's wishes, I only put as much of the problem text as necessary to understand the problem.

Visit the version with all the story elements [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1).

## Part 1
...[your puzzle input] appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.

For example, suppose you had the following report:

    199
    200
    208
    210
    200
    207
    240
    269
    260
    263

This report indicates that, scanning outward from the submarine, the sonar sweep found depths of 199, 200, 208, 210, and so on.

The first order of business is to figure out how quickly the depth increases

count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement

In the example above, the changes are as follows:

    199 (N/A - no previous measurement)
    200 (increased)
    208 (increased)
    210 (increased)
    200 (decreased)
    207 (increased)
    240 (increased)
    269 (increased)
    260 (decreased)
    263 (increased)

In this example, there are 7 measurements that are larger than the previous measurement.

How many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?
