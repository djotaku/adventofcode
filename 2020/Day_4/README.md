# Problem 1

The expected fields are as follows:

    byr (Birth Year)
    iyr (Issue Year)
    eyr (Expiration Year)
    hgt (Height)
    hcl (Hair Color)
    ecl (Eye Color)
    pid (Passport ID)
    cid (Country ID)

Count the number of valid entries - those that have all required fields. Treat cid as optional.

# Problem 2

You can continue to ignore the cid field, but each other field has strict rules about what values are valid for automatic validation:

    byr (Birth Year) - four digits; at least 1920 and at most 2002.
    iyr (Issue Year) - four digits; at least 2010 and at most 2020.
    eyr (Expiration Year) - four digits; at least 2020 and at most 2030.
    hgt (Height) - a number followed by either cm or in:
        If cm, the number must be at least 150 and at most 193.
        If in, the number must be at least 59 and at most 76.
    hcl (Hair Color) - a # followed by exactly six characters 0-9 or a-f.
    ecl (Eye Color) - exactly one of: amb blu brn gry grn hzl oth.
    pid (Passport ID) - a nine-digit number, including leading zeroes.
    cid (Country ID) - ignored, missing or not.

Your job is to count the inputs where all required fields are both present and valid according to the above rules.
