# Day 1- Airport Repair

## Part 1

There's actually a cute story to this, but I was informed on the subreddit that we're not to copy it to the repos. To see the cute story [click here](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)

Here's the basics so that I can remember what in the world this code was supposed to do: 

For part one you have a list of numbers, eg:

1721
979
366
299
675
1456

In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.

Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together? (that's what gets you a star for this problem)

## Part 2

Find three numbers in your list that meet the same criteria.

Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to 2020 are 979, 366, and 675. Multiplying them together produces the answer, 241861950.

What is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?
