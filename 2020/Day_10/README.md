# Part 1

You have a list of numbers. You need to arrange them so that each subsequent nubmer is, at most, 3 units larger than the previous one. Then add a three at the end.

Count how many differences of 1 and how many differences of 3 there are.

Multiply them together.

# Part 2

Following the same rules as above, how many different ways can you create valid chains of numbers. You can drop numbers out - that is each sequence doesn't need to use all the numbers. 

Answer input is the number of distinct arrangements.
