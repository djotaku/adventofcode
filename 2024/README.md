# Advent of Code 2024

Advent of Code 2024 can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

Need to fix the snow! 

My Ninth Advent of Code Problem Set

My goal for the 2024 problem sets are:

- Initially to keep working with Python and Go. (Maybe some Rust)
- In general my aim is to get more and more idiomatic with each language as the days go by.
- To have fun solving programming puzzles
