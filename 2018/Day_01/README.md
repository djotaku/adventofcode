## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
Part 1 seems relatively easy. Seems like we should just be able to do a sum (reductio) on the array.
### Part 2
My initial guess is that this isn't too hard, but it does require a bit more to it. I have to keep looping over my array until I get to a sum I've seen before.
