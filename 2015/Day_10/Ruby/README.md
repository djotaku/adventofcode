# What I learned on Day 10 about Ruby

## Part 1

- Learned about chunk and how it's basically what I had read existed in Haskell (in Haskell itâ€™s the group function). In Ruby chunk_while is actually a little more flexible than group (at least as presented in Learn You A Haskell for Great Good!) and can be used to group together sequential items in a list based on all kinds of boolean expressions. However, if with the a == b boolean, we get a list that keeps getting new items as long as they equal the previous one .After that it was a matter of putting the size of the list into the output to create the look-and-say pattern. Much easier than Python.
