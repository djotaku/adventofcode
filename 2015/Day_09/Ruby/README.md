# What I learned about Ruby on Day 09

## Part 1
- Getting really familiar with Ruby has functions
- a really neat little function - if you have an array you have the method - each_with_index (eg array.each_with_index) and if used as part of a for loop can be like Python's enumerate. 
- [array.permutation method](https://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Array:permutation)
