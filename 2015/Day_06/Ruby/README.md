# What I learned about Ruby on Day 06

## Part 1
- Practiced Ruby-style ranges
- got an even better understanding of string.scan which returns an array. In this case it would have been a multi-dimensional array. eg: ```[[0,0], [999,999]]```
- pratices some more with .to_i to turn a string into an int and .to_s to turn other things into strings. 
- used string.include for the instructions as a way to try and be more Ruby-ist vs regexes. Although I wasn't sure how to get the coordinates that way so that part had to be regex.
- used my first hash (Ruby dictionary)
- I don't know if Ruby can't return multiple values at once or I kept screwing somthing up, but I couldn't figure out the equivalent of tuple assignment with the output of get coordinates from text.
- once more practice with array.reduce
