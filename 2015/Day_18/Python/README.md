# What I learned About Python

## Part 1
- BOY OH BOY is doing this with dictionaries WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY better than doing it with lists! No need for guard clauses because you just use "get" on the dictionary and if you're beyond the grid it doesn't matter! Wish I knew this when I did the 2020 problem set! Would have made the seat day so much easier and faster and less error prone!!!
- A reminder (I've had to relearn this a few times) that if there isn't a space in your string, you need to use a list comprehension to split it into a list of characters.
