# What I learned from Day 3 in Ruby

## Part 1
- For separating a string I like that split works in Ruby. Had to do a for loop in Python.
- For Ruby [need an import to use sets](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.7.1/libdoc/set/rdoc/Set.html).
- Ruby can have lists in Sets. Python requires them to be immutables.

## Part 2
- I tried to use a similar notation to what I learned about in the alternate Day 1 solution using reduce to recreate a kind of enumerate in Ruby and that didn't work. In the future I'll search and see if there's an enumerate function in the standard library.
