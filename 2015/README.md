# Advent of Code 2015 - Santa's Weather Machine

Advent of Code 2015 can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

I am coming to the 2015 problem set after having first done the 2020 problem set as my first year.

My goal for the 2015 problem sets are:

- Continue to reinforce my knowledge of idiomatic Python and solving common algorithms (ranked #2 on Github 2021Q1)
- To solidify my knowledge of Ruby, which I began learning last year (ranked #5 on Github 2021Q1)
- To reacquaint myself with Perl, which I haven't used in about a decade (ranked #21 on Github 2021Q1)
- In general my aim is to get more and more idiomatic with each language as the days go by.
- To have fun solving programming puzzles

## Days I could not complete

### Language Specific

#### Perl
- Day 7 - Because I was using recursion and I had not yet relearned how to do subroutines (Perl functions)
- Day 14 - Because I didn't want to bother with classes in Perl

## What I learned from Advent of Code 2015

A distillation of what I learned this year.

- Perhaps this year I’m having a bit of hammer/nail disease, but having finally understood regex at the relatively simple level needed for AoC, I find that it makes nearly every problem infinitely easier compared to the way I did it in 2020 (mostly iterating over characters and keeping track of indexes, if needed)
- Confirmation of what I learned in 2020 - the right data structure is almost always the dictionary/hash. Nothing else is as performant.
- If you have recursion, you’ll probably have to do a cache to pass with the input given
- Looking like each year there’s at least one variant of Conway’s Game of Life - so learn the algorithm


For a full list of what I learned, for each day the README will contain what I learned in each programming language.

## note to self

using toolbox to be able to install cpan and ruby gems without mucking with system.

Launch with:

toolbox enter adventofcode
