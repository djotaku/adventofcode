# Advent of Code 2015 - Santa's Weather Machine

Advent of Code 2015 can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

I am coming to the 2015 problem set after having first done the 2020 problem set as my first year.

My goal for the 2015 problem sets are:

- Continue to reinforce my knowledge of idiomatic Python and solving common algorithms (ranked #2 on Github 2021Q1)
- To solidify my knowledge of Ruby, which I began learning last year (ranked #5 on Github 2021Q1)
- To reacquaint myself with Perl, which I haven't used in about a decade (ranked #21 on Github 2021Q1)
- To have fun solving programming puzzles

## Days I could not complete

None yet....

## What I learned from Advent of Code 2015

Right now I think this will be a subset of what I learned from doing each problem. For a full list of what I learned, for each day the README will contain what I learned in each programming language.

## note to self

using toolbox to be able to install cpan and ruby gems without mucking with system.

Launch with:
