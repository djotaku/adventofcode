# Advent of Code 2015

Advent of Code 2015 can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

I am coming to the 2015 problem set after having first done the 2020 problem set as my first year.

My goal for the 2015 problem sets are:

- Continue to reinforce my knowledge of idiomatic Python and solving common algorithms
- To solidify my knowledge of Ruby, which I began learning last year
- To reacquaint myself with Perl, which I haven't used in about a decade
- To have fun solving programming puzzles

## What I learned from Advent of Code 2015

Nothing yet....I haven't started!
