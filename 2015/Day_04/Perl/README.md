# What I learned using Perl for Day 4

## Part 1

- Using [Digest::MD5](https://metacpan.org/pod/Digest::MD5) (didn't need to add - guess part of basic Perl 5?)
- Using the regular expression here vs the way I did comparisons in Ruby and Python made this one BLAZING fast. On a laptop that's waaaaay weaker than the desktop in which I ran the Ruby and Python when getting the answer it was near instantaneious vs the desktop w/ the Python and Ruby solutions where it was a few seconds before the answer showed up. That's pretty incredible!
