# What I learned about Python

## Part 1
- Nothing

## Part 2
- On lines where I was doing the less than comparison it was failing if it was a None value. So I had to make use of the fact order in which truthiness is evaluated in Python to make the order go away. I had to check for None and THEN check numerically.
