# Day 17: No Such Thing as Too Much

ut of respect for the author's wishes, I only put as much of the problem text as necessary to understand the problem.

Visit the version with all the story elements [here](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/17).

## Part 1
[You have] 150 liters [of eggnog] this time. To fit it all into your refrigerator, you'll need to move it into smaller containers. You take an inventory of the capacities of the available containers.

For example, suppose you have containers of size 20, 15, 10, 5, and 5 liters. If you need to store 25 liters, there are four ways to do it:

- 15 and 10
- 20 and 5 (the first 5)
- 20 and 5 (the second 5)
- 15, 5, and 5

Filling all containers entirely, how many different combinations of containers can exactly fit all 150 liters of eggnog?

Answer: 1638

## Part 2
Find the minimum number of containers that can exactly fit all 150 liters of eggnog. How many different ways can you fill that number of containers and still hold exactly 150 litres?

In the example above, the minimum number of containers was two. There were three ways to use that many containers, and so the answer there would be 3.

## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
I came to the problem with what I'd learned on Day 15 about using combinations or permutations with constraints.
