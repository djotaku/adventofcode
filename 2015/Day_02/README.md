## Part 1

find the surface area of the box, which is 2*l*w + 2*w*h + 2*h*l. They also need a little extra paper for each box: the area of the smallest side.

For example:

- A present with dimensions 2x3x4 requires 2*6 + 2*12 + 2*8 = 52 square feet of wrapping paper plus 6 square feet of slack, for a total of 58 square feet.
- A present with dimensions 1x1x10 requires 2*1 + 2*10 + 2*10 = 42 square feet of wrapping paper plus 1 square foot of slack, for a total of 43 square feet.

All numbers in the list are in feet. How many total square feet of wrapping paper should they order?
