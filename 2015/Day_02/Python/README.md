# What I learned from Python

## Part 1

- It's my first time using reduce. I thought I wanted to use accumulate, 
but that returns an iterator. Since I just wanted to add things up
  reduce was just fine. Also my first time writing a lamba function. Woohoo!
  
## Part 2
- Nothing new compared to part 1.
