# Ruby notes:

- Began better understanding the .each syntax and how that works.
- Ends can get a bit tricky. I'd prefer Python where we're using whitespace or
Perl where we're using '{'
- Something about the way I imported my parser means that I just use the method name
and don't include the filename.
- [an alternate solution](https://github.com/djotaku/adventofcode/blob/main/2015/Day_01/Ruby/alternate_part_1.rb) for Ruby from /u/matheusrich on /r/ruby taught me how to use reduce in a way that seems to combine it with Python's enumerate
