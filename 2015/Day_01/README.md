# Part 1

An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.

The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.

For example:

    (()) and ()() both result in floor 0.
    ((( and (()(()( both result in floor 3.
    ))((((( also results in floor 3.
    ()) and ))( both result in floor -1 (the first basement level).
    ))) and )())()) both result in floor -3.

To what floor do the instructions lead?

Answer: 280
