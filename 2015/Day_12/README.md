## Part 1

They have a JSON document which contains a variety of things: arrays ([1,2,3]), objects ({"a":1, "b":2}), numbers, and strings. Your first job is to simply find all of the numbers throughout the document and add them together.

For example:

[1,2,3] and {"a":2,"b":4} both have a sum of 6.
[[[3]]] and {"a":{"b":4},"c":-1} both have a sum of 3.
{"a":[-1,1]} and [-1,{"a":1}] both have a sum of 0.
[] and {} both have a sum of 0.
You will not encounter any strings containing numbers.

What is the sum of all numbers in the document?
