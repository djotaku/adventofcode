# What I learned in Python Day 05

## Part 1
- The bool function - see rule 2.
- When to use findall vs search or match. Still slightly shakey, but I'm better at it than before.
- using back references to match doubles. My original rule 2 didn't work. 
- Been watching a lot of [this guy's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1kBxkk2bcG78YBX7LMl9pQ) youtube channel so I was thinking in terms of map, filter, reduce (it's almost always the algorithm in the problems he solves). So that led to the code I had in the main function. 

## Part 2
- The key to rule 1 was to use find_all which automatically excludes overlaps. Then I just had to figure out the regex.
- using backslash and a number to refer to a repetition of a parenthesis'd number
- once I understood that, rule 2 was easy
