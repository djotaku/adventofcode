# Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?

Out of respect for the author's wishes, I only put as much of the problem text as necessary to understand the problem.

Visit the version with all the story elements [here](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/5).

## Part 1
A nice string is one with all of the following properties:

- It contains at least three vowels (aeiou only), like aei, xazegov, or aeiouaeiouaeiou.
- It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like xx, abcdde (dd), or aabbccdd (aa, bb, cc, or dd).
- It does not contain the strings ab, cd, pq, or xy, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.

For example:

- ugknbfddgicrmopn is nice because it has at least three vowels (u...i...o...), a double letter (...dd...), and none of the disallowed substrings.
- aaa is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.
- jchzalrnumimnmhp is naughty because it has no double letter.
- haegwjzuvuyypxyu is naughty because it contains the string xy.
- dvszwmarrgswjxmb is naughty because it contains only one vowel.

How many strings are nice?

- Looks like this is when I'm probably going to end up using regular expressions in all the solutions
