# What I learned from Day 14 in Ruby
## Part 1
- Nothing new

## Part 2
- Ruby classes and how to initialize them
- using sort to sort by custom variables in a class
- It appears you cannot just access variables in a Ruby class, you have to have a method to return the value. (At least that's what it seemed like when I tried to access it.)
