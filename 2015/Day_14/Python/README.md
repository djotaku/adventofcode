# What I learned on Day 14 in Python

## Part 1
- Nothing. I thought about doing a namedTuple with the regex parsing, but decided not to.

## Part 2
- I am pretty sure I over-thought this. However, what's most interesting is that this is one of those times where I couldn't get the unit test to work and yet was able to get the right answer.
