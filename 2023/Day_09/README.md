## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
This seems complicated, but I think I have an idea of how I would solve it. 

- As I figure out each line, just save off the final number in the sequence. (Store in a list/array) 
- Get to all 0s. 
- For each number in the list, add it to the one before it. 
- That's your number for this line
- Gather up all the numbers for all the lines and sum.

Went with recursion, almost got it, but had to hold one number out from the recursion.
### Part 2
Seems like it should be the same as part 1, but subtraction instead. (And from the front of the list/array)
