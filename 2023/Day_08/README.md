## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
Seems as simple as creating a dictionary. I imagine part 2 will be a traveling salesman or similar thing. Cache may be useful in part 1 or part 2.
### Part 2
Naive implementation didn't work. Tried lru_cache. That didn't seem to work either. 

This is one of those problems that I'm so bad at where you have to find the pattern rather than actual programming. So the solution is to find the least common multiple of each of the starting points to a Z ending point.
