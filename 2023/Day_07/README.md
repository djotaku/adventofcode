## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
If I wanted to take a bunch of time, I think this problem could benefit from creating a class so that I can define less than and greater than. I'm going to try and do this with functional programming because my class skills aren't so great that it woudl be an easy slam-dunk for me.

Planning on using the Counter from the Python Collections library.

Looks like I need to implement a sorting algorithm to solve it in the end. Decided to try a merge sort, since part 2 might blow things up. 
### Part 2
Looks like I need to make 2 changes. First I need to change the card labels array (or have a part 2 one) to move J to the end for ties.

Second, I need to modify the determine_hand algo. That's the bigger challenge, I think.
