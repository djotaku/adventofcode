# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of Code 2023 can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Need to fix the snow! 

My Eighth Advent of Code Problem Set

My goal for the 2023 problem sets are:

- Keep working with Python, Ruby, and Perl, Go, and Haskell
- In general my aim is to get more and more idiomatic with each language as the days go by.
- To have fun solving programming puzzles
