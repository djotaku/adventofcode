# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of Code 2023 can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Need to fix the snow! 

My Eighth Advent of Code Problem Set

My goal for the 2023 problem sets are:

- Keep working with Python, Ruby, and Perl, Go, and Haskell
- In general my aim is to get more and more idiomatic with each language as the days go by.
- To have fun solving programming puzzles

## Days I could not complete
### Part 1 Sections Still incomplete:
- Day 10 - I was busy with other stuff, but started laying the groundwork for completing this.

### Part 2 Sections Still incomplete:
- Day 04 - I think I have a rough idea of what I need to do to get the answer, but I need to fix the recursion. 
- Day 05 - didn't think about how I was going to do part 2 without crashing the computer.
### Language Specific
- Nothing Yet
