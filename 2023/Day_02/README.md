Out of respect for the author's wishes, I only put as much of the problem text as necessary to understand the problem.

## Part 1
Answer: 2196
## Part 2
Answer: 60948
## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
Strategy for part 1 is to consider each round and simply see if any of the numbers are invalid for that round.
### Part 2
For part 2 I will use the same regex to get the cubes and use a max function on it to find the max number for each color. Then multiply them together to get the round's power.
