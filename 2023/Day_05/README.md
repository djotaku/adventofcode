## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
This description was bananas and took me 3 times reading through to understand what was going on. I think it's actually probably not too hard to set things up. I will make a few lists per category. Then go from map to map to map. (there's probably a shortcut considering mapping is a function in functional programming.) At the end do a min() on the final locations.

Thinking about it a bit more - map...ie dictionary. I will make dictionaries that can be looked up. This makes it easier for categories where there are multiple ranges.

The solution found in [this commit](https://github.com/djotaku/adventofcode/blob/163353d4da1f354eac58e1b2594f6e0ebc3ca076/2023/Day_05/Python/day_05.py) causes my computer to run out of RAM. Will need to resturcture the solution.
