## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
This seems like the perfect problem for a dictionary/map/hash. It will also help in Python to use a default dict with default values of "." so that I don't have to worry about the edges of the diagram when looking for neighbors. 
### Part 2
Because of how complex it was to find the numbers in part 1 (since they're more than 1 digit), I think I will try and modify my current functions and use those to do part two. First thought is to save off the coordinates of numbers and then find the asterisks and check coordinates. 

Key to solving this one was (as often is the case) - reading very carefully since the asterisk had to have EXACTLY 2 valid part numbers, not more than that.
