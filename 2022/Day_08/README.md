## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
First pass at how to do this is to load the tree map into a dictionary. Then for each point on the map, see it can be seen in the cardinal directions.
### Part 2
Strategy here will be to utilize a similar algorithm as before, but this time I don't want true/false. I want to count until I get to a tree that's bigger or same size.
