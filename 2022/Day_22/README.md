## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
- Make a default dict with “” for the spaces with no walkway, “.” for walkway, and “#” for walls. 
    - That should help get the indexing right. Rather than correcting at the end, maybe just go ahead and start counting from 1,1
- Parse the command - perhaps a regex that finds numbers and letters? Or numbers and L/R? Will have to play with this a bit
