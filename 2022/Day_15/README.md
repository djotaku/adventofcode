## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
Ah, my old friend Taxicab (Manahattan) Distance from 2015 or 2016. I think my approach is to use taxicab distance to figure out the max distance from the sensor, this is why we have the diamond shape in the example.

I was planning on putting the coordinates into a set (expecting potential set math in part 2) and then checking for the row values.

The strategy I was thinking of would give me the perimeter. Need to figure out the best way to get the interior points. Right now I'm thinking that you take the perimeter points at the same y value and then fill in the Xs in between.

Today I may break out the unit tests again.
