## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
Because each minute you have many robot possibilities to build (based on what you have resources for), I'm thinking of
just doing a brute force like I did with [2015 - Day 22](https://github.com/djotaku/adventofcode/tree/main/2015/Day_22).

Thinking of doing output like the example just to keep what I'm doing understandable. (Then again, it might get out of control if I'm brute forcing it)
