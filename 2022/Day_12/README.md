## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
I'm not good at these, I never know how to actually do it. I know that, generally, it's something like:

- figure out every direction you can go from your current spot
- branch out and try each of those
- If any branch reaches a dead end, stop having that branch go.
- at the end, pick the one that meets the criteria (fewest, most, etc)

Where I struggle is how to do the second step. 

Looks like I'm finally learning BFS. 

I'm going to be adapting the code from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-path-in-a-binary-maze/ to work with my grid. I don't normally bother with classes and I think namedTuple might even work better here, but for simplicity's sake I'm going to go with their method.
