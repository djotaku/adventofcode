## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
 -Use normal multiple lines in function
- For loop for the next part 
- Cut string in half (or use enumeration -or language equivalent to know when you're at the halfway point. If doing this, skip to next step)
- Go over each letter per half of string and put it into a set
- Set subtraction tells you which letter is by itself
- Put the letter into a list that's outside this for loop
- Using a letter-value dictionary, figure out what each letter is worth (Ruby and Haskell can probably use map function for this. Python can use list compensation or map)
Sum
