# Day 3 - Rucksack Reorganization

Out of respect for the author's wishes, I only put as much of the problem text as necessary to understand the problem.

- The first rucksack contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp, which means its first compartment contains the items vJrwpWtwJgWr, while the second compartment contains the items hcsFMMfFFhFp. The only item type that appears in both compartments is lowercase p.
- The second rucksack's compartments contain jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGL and rsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL. The only item type that appears in both compartments is uppercase L.
- The third rucksack's compartments contain PmmdzqPrV and vPwwTWBwg; the only common item type is uppercase P.
- The fourth rucksack's compartments only share item type v.
- The fifth rucksack's compartments only share item type t.
- The sixth rucksack's compartments only share item type s.
To help prioritize item rearrangement, every item type can be converted to a priority:

- Lowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26.
- Uppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52.
In the above example, the priority of the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack is 16 (p), 38 (L), 42 (P), 22 (v), 20 (t), and 19 (s); the sum of these is 157.

Find the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack. What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?

Answer: 8088
## Part 2
The only way to tell which item type is the right one is by finding the one item type that is common between all three Elves in each group.

Every set of three lines in your list corresponds to a single group, but each group can have a different badge item type. So, in the above example, the first group's rucksacks are the first three lines:

In the first (three lines), the only item type that appears in all three rucksacks is lowercase r; this must be their badges. In the second group, their badge item type must be Z.

Priorities for these items must still be found to organize the sticker attachment efforts: here, they are 18 (r) for the first group and 52 (Z) for the second group. The sum of these is 70.

Find the item type that corresponds to the badges of each three-Elf group. What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?

Answer: 2522
## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
 -Use normal multiple lines in function
- For loop for the next part 
- Cut string in half (or use enumeration -or language equivalent to know when you're at the halfway point. If doing this, skip to next step)
- Go over each letter per half of string and put it into a set
- Set subtraction tells you which letter is by itself
- Put the letter into a list that's outside this for loop
- Using a letter-value dictionary, figure out what each letter is worth (Ruby and Haskell can probably use map function for this. Python can use list compensation or map)
Sum

### Part 2
I think I can do a modified version of what I was doing above, only with lines instead of halves of lines. And comparing 3 lines.
