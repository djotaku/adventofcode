## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
- I think use a dict of dicts where the key is the dir name. Values are the file sizes within each dictionary. I think just sum them as we donâ€™t seem to need to keep them.
- Need path parser function(s)

Needed some help to go from the example to the input because of multiple directories with the same name.
