### Part 1
This reminds me a lot of the problem from [2015 Day 7](https://github.com/djotaku/adventofcode/blob/main/2015/Day_07/Python/part_1_memoization.py) so I'm going to start off with that as my solution idea.

That is, use an lru cache and a dictionary to recursively find the answer for the root mnonkey's math.
