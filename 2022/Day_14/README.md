## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
NOTE: y= 0 is the TOP of the cavern

No diagonal lines - all are vertical or horizontal

- Figure out the rock layouts and put that into the grid/dict
- Create sand sim that has sand fall until it is touching rock or other sand and cannot fall left/right
- When it can’t fall left or right - add 1 to counter
- If sand starts falling “forever” (define forever) then you know it’s gone over the edge?
- Maybe we define the lowest rock and if it the sand has a higher y value than that, then we know we’re done
