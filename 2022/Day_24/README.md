## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
Seems that the solution is a BFS where the next spot you can move to is dynamically calculated. I guess the best thing to do is to calculate what the situation will be on the NEXT turn. Use that to know where to move (or even if you have to stay). Having to stay means pushing yourself onto the queue, I think. This wil definitely take some careful thinking to set up correctly.
