## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
In Python, at least, the approach for part 1 seems very simple. Parse the input and calculate a sum until you get to a newline.
Put this sum into a list. Use Python's max function to find the maximum number. Made easier by the fact that we don't care 
which elf has the calories, just the amount.
