## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
First attempt at figuring out an answer:
- Number of lines in input * 6 is the max number of sides
- I think each time a pair of points match, that's a side that matches so tally those up and and subtract from the above number. (Of course, the logic is in the tally)
