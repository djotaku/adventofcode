## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
Because we have to keep track of how many times a monkey has inspected an item, I will have a dictionary of monkeys. One key will be items and it will hold a deque of items so I can do a pop from the left. Another key will hold a count of inspected items. 
Other keys will hold their operation and test values.
