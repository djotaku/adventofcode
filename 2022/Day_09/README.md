## Commentary / Approach to the Problem
### Part 1
Seems like the keys are:
- Is Tail in the same row or column as Head? (Do they share x or y coordinates)
    - If yes, move straight
    - If no, move diagonally
- Are they touching? If so, do not need to move tail (includes diagonal checks)
- Need a Set to keep track of points visited so you count them only once

Since we're not given any initial map, just start at (0,0) with head on tail
