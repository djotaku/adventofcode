# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of Code 2022 can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Traipsing through the jungle because you need to help the elves collect [star fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carambola) to power Santa's reindeer. 

My Fifth Advent of Code Problem Set

My goal for the 2022 problem sets are:

- Keep working with Python, Ruby, and Perl, Go, and Haskell
- In general my aim is to get more and more idiomatic with each language as the days go by.
- To have fun solving programming puzzles

## Days I could not complete
### Part 1 Sections Still incomplete:
- Day 15 - need help with algorithm for part 1
- Day 16 - will probably run out of day before I can even really get started on this one. Did write down some ideas, though.
- Day 17 - busy day and complicated sim.  Ran out of day before I could finish. Was debugging the horizontal line.
- Day 19 - no time to work on it today. Have some ideas based on 2015 day 22 - maybe brute forcing it.
- Day 22 - I think I'm close, but have some bugs and ran out of day. Will probably come back to this one first when I attempt to do some more days.
### Part 2 Sections Still incomplete:
- Day 18 - spent way too long confused about why my part 1 wasn't working. Don't quite understand the geometry necessary for part 2.
- Day 21 - unsure how to modify the algorithm to work for part 2.
### Language Specific
- Nothing Yet
## What I learned from Advent of Code 2022

A distillation of what I learned this year:
- TBD!


For a full list of what I learned, for each day the README will contain what I learned in each programming language.

### Python

### Ruby

### Perl

### Go

### Haskell

### Rust

### Julia

## note to self

using toolbox to be able to install cpan and ruby gems without mucking with system.
