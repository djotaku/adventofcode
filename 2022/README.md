# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of Code 2022 can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

You need to help the elves collect [star fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carambola) to power Santa's reindeer. 

My Fifth Advent of Code Problem Set

My goal for the 2022 problem sets are:

- Keep working with Python, Ruby, and Perl, Go, and Haskell
- In general my aim is to get more and more idiomatic with each language as the days go by.
- To have fun solving programming puzzles
