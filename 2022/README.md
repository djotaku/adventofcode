# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of Code 2022 can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Traipsing through the jungle because you need to help the elves collect [star fruit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carambola) to power Santa's reindeer. 

My Fifth Advent of Code Problem Set

My goal for the 2022 problem sets are:

- Keep working with Python, Ruby, and Perl, Go, and Haskell
- In general my aim is to get more and more idiomatic with each language as the days go by.
- To have fun solving programming puzzles

## Days I could not complete
### Part 1 Sections Still incomplete:
- Day 15 - need help with algorithm for part 1
- Day 16 - will probably run out of day before I can even really get started on this one. Did write down some ideas, though.
### Part 2 Sections Still incomplete:
- Nothing yet
### Language Specific
- Nothing Yet

## note to self

using toolbox to be able to install cpan and ruby gems without mucking with system.

Launch with:

toolbox enter adventofcode
