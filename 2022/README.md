My (blank) Advent of Code Problem Set

My goal for the 2022 problem sets are:

- Keep working with Python, Ruby, and Perl, Go, and Haskell
- Learn Rust
- Learn Julia
- In general my aim is to get more and more idiomatic with each language as the days go by.
- To have fun solving programming puzzles

(progress image will go here)
